## What skills I used

- Integrated third party libraries in app using Cocoapods.
- Data in CoreData database.
- Made query and sort the database.
- Worked with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.

I use CocoaPods (1.11.3), [Chameleon (2.1.0)](https://github.com/wowansm/Chameleon), [SwipeCellKit (2.7.1)](https://github.com/SwipeCellKit/SwipeCellKit)
